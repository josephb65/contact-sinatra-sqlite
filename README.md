# Contact App - Sinatra & SQLite Starter

This is a simple web app built with Sinatra, that allows users to login/logout and create contacts. Users can modify and delete only the contacts that they own. Bootstrap is used for styling and is already included via CDN links.

The `master` branch of this repo holds a starter that I setup if anyone wants to start a basic project with Sinatra. The working project will be pushed to the `dev` branch.

To start working with this starter you have to:
- Fork this repo
- Clone the master branch with: `git clone repo-url local-repo-name`
- Run `bundle install` or `bundle install --path vendor` if you dont want to isntall all the dependencies globally and just for the project.

This starter is distributed under the `MIT` licence that can be found in this repo named `LICENSE`.

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to improve this starter by sending a `pull request`.
